description: |
  MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and 
  flexibility. It allows you to mix the flavours of symbolic programming and 
  imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. In its core, 
  a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic 
  and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of 
  that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The library is 
  portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.
