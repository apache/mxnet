## 1.6.0

### Deprecation of Python 2

MXNet community [voted](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r3a2db0f22a1680cc56804191446fef2289595798ca19fd17de1ff03e%40%3Cdev.mxnet.apache.org%3E) to no longer support Python 2 in future releases of MXNet. Therefore, MXNet 1.6 release is going to be the last MXNet release to support Python 2.

### New features

#### NumPy compatible interface and using TVM to generate operators

NumPy has long been established as the standard math library in Python, the most prevalent language for the deep learning community. With this library as the cornerstone, there are now the largest ecosystem and community for scientific computing. The popularity of NumPy comes from its flexibility and generality.

In #14253, the MXNet community reached consensus on moving towards a NumPy-compatible programing experience and committed to a major endeavor on providing NumPy compatible operators.

The primary goal of the projects below is to provide the equivalent usability and expressiveness of NumPy in MXNet to facilitate Deep Learning model development, which not only helps existing deep learning practitioners but also provides people in the existing NumPy community with a shortcut for getting started in Deep Learning. The efforts towards this goal would also help a secondary goal, which is to enable the existing NumPy ecosystem to utilize GPUs and accelerators to speed up large scale computation.

#### Graph optimizations

##### Pointwise fusion for GPU

DL models, besides compute intensive operations like convolutions and fully connected layers, feature a lot of simple pointwise (aka elementwise) operations (like elementwise addition etc.). Performance of those operations is fully memory bandwidth bound and so limit speedups from newer GPU hardware, which typically has high compute/memory bandwidth ratio. When multiple of such operations are chained one after another, it results in a series of unnecessary stores and loads as well as potential increased memory usage to store the intermediate results. Pointwise fusion helps in alleviating those problems by just-in-time generation of fused operators, which do not store intermediate results in memory, resulting in performance and memory usage improvements.

## 1.5.0

### New Features

#### Automatic Mixed Precision(experimental)
Training Deep Learning networks is a very computationally intensive task. Novel model architectures tend to have increasing numbers of layers and parameters, which slow down training. Fortunately, software optimizations and new generations of training hardware make it a feasible task.
However, most of the hardware and software optimization opportunities exist in exploiting lower precision (e.g. FP16) to, for example, utilize Tensor Cores available on new Volta and Turing GPUs. While training in FP16 showed great success in image classification tasks, other more complicated neural networks typically stayed in FP32 due to difficulties in applying the FP16 training guidelines.
That is where AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) comes into play. It automatically applies the guidelines of FP16 training, using FP16 precision where it provides the most benefit, while conservatively keeping in full FP32 precision operations unsafe to do in FP16. To learn more about AMP, check out this [tutorial](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/docs/tutorials/amp/amp_tutorial.md).

#### MKL-DNN Reduced precision inference and RNN API support
Two advanced features, fused computation and reduced-precision kernels, are introduced by MKL-DNN in the recent version. These features can significantly speed up the inference performance on CPU for a broad range of deep learning topologies. MXNet MKL-DNN backend provides optimized implementations for various operators covering a broad range of applications including image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. Refer to the [MKL-DNN operator documentation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/v1.5.x/docs/tutorials/mkldnn/operator_list.md) for more information.

#### Dynamic Shape(experimental)
MXNet now supports Dynamic Shape in both imperative and symbolic mode. MXNet used to require that operators statically infer the output shapes from the input shapes. However, there exist some operators that don't meet this requirement. Examples are:
* while_loop: its output size depends on the number of iterations in the loop.
* boolean indexing: its output size depends on the value of the input data.
* many operators can be extended to take a shape symbol as input and the shape symbol can determine the output shape of these operators (with this extension, the symbol interface of MXNet can fully support shape).
To support dynamic shape and such operators, we have modified MXNet backend. Now MXNet supports operators with dynamic shape such as [`contrib.while_loop`](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/contrib.html#mxnet.ndarray.contrib.while_loop), [`contrib.cond`](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/contrib.html#mxnet.ndarray.contrib.cond), and [`mxnet.ndarray.contrib.boolean_mask`](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/contrib.html#contrib)
Note: Currently dynamic shape does not work with Gluon deferred initialization.

#### Large Tensor Support
Currently, MXNet supports maximal tensor size of around 4 billon (2^32). This is due to uint32_t being used as the default data type for tensor size, as well as variable indexing.
This limitation has created many problems when larger tensors are used in the model.
A naive solution to this problem is to replace all uint32_t in the MXNet backend source code to int64_t.
This solution is not viable, however, because many data structures use uint32_t as the data type for its members.
Unnecessarily replacing these variables to int64_t will increase the memory consumption causing another limitation. Second, MXNet has many submodule dependencies.
Updating the variable types in the MXNet repository is not enough. We also need to make sure different libraries, such as MKLDNN, MShadow etc. supports the int64_t integer data type.
Third, many front end APIs assume unsigned 32-bit integer interface. Only updating the interface in C/C++ will cause all the language bindings to fail.
Therefore, we need a systematic approach to enhance MXNet to support large tensors.
Now you can enable large tensor support by changing the following build flag to 1: `USE_INT64_TENSOR_SIZE = 1`. Note this is set to 0 by default.
For more details please refer to the [design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Large+Tensor+Support).

#### Dependency Update
MXNet has added support for CUDA 10, CUDA 10.1, cudnn7.5, NCCL 2.4.2, and numpy 1.16.0.
These updates are available through PyPI packages and build from source, refer to [installation guide](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/master/install/index.html) for more details.

#### Gluon Fit API(experimental)
Training a model in Gluon requires users to write the training loop. This is useful because of its imperative nature, however repeating the same code across multiple models can become tedious and repetitive with boilerplate code.
The training loop can also be overwhelming to some users new to deep learning. We have introduced an Estimator and Fit API to help facilitate training loop.
Note: this feature is still experimental, for more details, refer to [design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Gluon+Fit+API+-+Tech+Design).

### New Features
#### Java Inference API

Model inference is often managed in a production ecosystem using primarily Java/Scala tools and frameworks. This release seeks to alleviate the need for software engineers to write custom MXNet wrappers to fit their production environment.

Inference on a trained model has a couple of common use cases:

  1. Real-time or Online Inference - tasks that require immediate feedback, such as fraud detection
  2. Batch or Offline Inference - tasks that don't require immediate feedback, these are use cases where you have massive amounts of data and want to run inference or pre-compute inference results
Real-time Inference is often performed and deployed on popular web frameworks such as Tomcat, Netty, Jetty, etc., all of which use Java.
Batch Inference is often performed on big data platforms such as Spark using Scala or Java.

With this project, we had the following goals:
* Build a new set of APIs that are Java friendly, compatible with Java 7+, are easy to use for inference.
* Lower the barrier to entry of consuming MXNet for production use cases.

More details can be found at the [Java Inference API document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Java+Inference+API).

#### Julia API

MXNet.jl is the Julia package of Apache MXNet. MXNet.jl brings flexible and efficient GPU computing and state-of-art deep learning to Julia. Some highlights of features include:

  * Efficient tensor/matrix computation across multiple devices, including multiple CPUs, GPUs and distributed server nodes.
  * Flexible manipulation of symbolic to composite for construction of state-of-the-art deep learning models.

#### Control Flow Operators (experimental)

Today we observe more and more dynamic neural network models, especially in the fields of natural language processing and graph analysis. The dynamics in these models come from multiple sources, including:

  * Models are expressed with control flow, such as conditions and loops;
  * NDArrays in a model may have dynamic shapes, meaning the NDArrays of a model or some of the NDArrays have different shapes for different batches;
  * Models may want to use more dynamic data structures, such as lists or dictionaries.
It's natural to express dynamic models in frameworks with an imperative programming interface (e.g., Gluon, Pytorch, TensorFlow Eager). In this kind of interface, developers can use Python control flows, or NDArrays with any shape at any moment, or use Python lists and dictionaries to store data as they want. The problem of this approach is that it highly dependent on the originating front-end programming language (mainly Python). A model implemented in one language can only run in the same language.

A common use case is that machine learning scientists want to develop their models in Python, whereas engineers who deploy the models usually have to use a different "production" language (e.g., Java or C). Gluon tries to close the gap between the model development and production deployment. Machine learning scientists design and implement their models in Python with the imperative interface, and then Gluon converts the implementations from imperative to symbolic by invoking `hybridize()` for model exporting.

The goal of this project is to enhance Gluon to turn a dynamic neural network into a static computation graph. The dynamic control flows are expressed by control flow operators with Gluon hybridization, and these are exported for deployment.

More information can be found at [Optimize dynamic neural network models with control flow operators](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Optimize+dynamic+neural+network+models+with+control+flow+operators)

#### SVRG Optimization

SVRG stands for Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient, which was first introduced in the paper [Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predicative Variance Reduction in 2013](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf). It is an optimization technique that complements SGD.

SGD is known for large scale optimization, but it suffers from slow convergence asymptotically due to the inherent variance. SGD approximates the full gradient using a small batch of samples which introduces variance. In order to converge faster, SGD often needs to start with a smaller learning rate.

SVRG remedies the slow convergence problem by keeping a version of the estimated weights that is close to the optimal parameters and maintains the average of the full gradient over the full pass of data. The average of the full gradients of all data is calculated w.r.t to parameters of last mth epochs. It has provable guarantees for strongly convex smooth functions; a detailed proof can be found in section 3 of the [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf). SVRG uses a different update rule than SGD: gradients w.r.t current parameters minus gradients w.r.t parameters from the last mth epoch, plus the average of gradients over all data.

Key Characteristics of SVRG:

  * Explicit variance reduction
  * Ability to use relatively large learning rate compared to SGD, which leads to faster convergence.
More details can be found at [SVRG Optimization in MXNet Python Module](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Unified+integration+with+external+backend+libraries)

#### Subgraph API (experimental)

MXNet can integrate with many different kinds of backend libraries, including TVM, MKLDNN, TensorRT, Intel nGraph and more. In general, these backends support a limited number of operators, so running computation in a model usually involves an interaction between backend-supported operators and MXNet operators. These backend libraries share some common requirements:

TVM , MKLDNN and nGraph use customized data formats. Interaction between these backends with MXNet requires data format conversion.
TVM, MKLDNN, TensorRT and nGraph fuses operators.
Integration with these backends should happen in the granularity of subgraphs instead of in the granularity of operators. To fuse operators, it's obvious that we need to divide a graph into subgraphs so that the operators in a subgraph can be fused into a single operator. To handle customized data formats, we should partition a computation graph into subgraphs as well. Each subgraph contains only TVM, MKLDNN or nGraph operators. In this way, MXNet converts data formats only when entering such a subgraph, and the operators inside a subgraph handle format conversion themselves if necessary. This makes interaction of TVM and MKLDNN with MXNet much easier. Neither the MXNet executor nor the MXNet operators need to deal with customized data formats. Even though invoking these libraries from MXNet requires similar steps, the partitioning rule and the subgraph execution of these backends can be different. As such, we define the following interface for backends to customize graph partitioning and subgraph execution inside an operator. More details can be found at PR 12157 and [Subgraph API](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Unified+integration+with+external+backend+libraries).

#### JVM Memory Management

The MXNet Scala and Java API uses native memory to manage NDArray, Symbol, Executor, DataIterators using MXNet's internal C APIs.  The C APIs provide appropriate interfaces to create, access and free these objects. MXNet Scala has corresponding Wrappers and APIs that have pointer references to the native memory. Before this project, JVM users (e.g. Scala, Clojure, or Java) of MXNet have to manage MXNet objects manually using the dispose pattern. There are a few usability problems with this approach:

* Users have to track the MXNet objects manually and remember to call `dispose`. This is not Java idiomatic and not user friendly. Quoting a user: "this feels like I am writing C++ code which I stopped ages ago".
* Leads to memory leaks if `dispose` is not called.
* Many objects in MXNet-Scala are managed in native memory, needing to use `dispose` on them as well.
* Bloated code with `dispose()` methods.
* Hard to debug memory-leaks.
Goals of the project are:
* Provide MXNet JVM users automated memory management that can release native memory when there are no references to JVM objects.
* Provide automated memory management for both GPU and CPU memory without performance degradation.  More details can be found here: [JVM Memory Management](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/JVM+Memory+Management)

#### Topology-aware AllReduce (experimental)
For distributed training, the `Reduce` communication patterns used by NCCL and MXNet are not optimal for small batch sizes. The `Topology-aware AllReduce` approach is based on the idea of using trees to perform the `Reduce` and `Broadcast` operations. We can use the idea of minimum spanning trees to do a binary tree `Reduce` communication pattern to improve distributed training following this paper by Wang, Li, Edo and Smola [1]. Our strategy is to use:

  * a single tree (latency-optimal for small messages) to handle `Reduce` on small messages
  * multiple trees (bandwidth-optimal for large messages) to handle `Reduce` on large messages

More details can be found here: [Topology-aware AllReduce](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Single+machine+All+Reduce+Topology-aware+Communication)
Note: This is an experimental feature and has known problems - see [13341](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13341). Please help to contribute to improve the robustness of the feature.

#### MKLDNN backend: Graph optimization and Quantization (experimental)

Two advanced features, graph optimization (operator fusion) and reduced-precision (INT8) computation, are introduced to MKLDNN backend in this release ([#12530](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12530), [#13297](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13297), [#13260](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13260)).
These features significantly boost the inference performance on CPU (up to 4X) for a broad range of deep learning topologies. Currently, this feature is only available for inference on platforms with [supported Intel CPUs](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn#system-requirements).

##### Graph Optimization
MKLDNN backend takes advantage of MXNet subgraph to implement the most of possible operator fusions for inference, such as Convolution + ReLU, Batch Normalization folding, etc. When using mxnet-mkl package, users can easily enable this feature by setting export MXNET_SUBGRAPH_BACKEND=MKLDNN.

##### Quantization
Performance of reduced-precision (INT8) computation is also dramatically improved after the graph optimization feature is applied on CPU Platforms. Various models are supported and can benefit from reduced-precision computation, including symbolic models, Gluon models and even custom models. Users can run most of the pre-trained models with only a few lines of commands and a new quantization script imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py. The observed accuracy loss is less than 0.5% for popular CNN networks, like ResNet-50, Inception-BN, MobileNet, etc.

Please find detailed information and performance/accuracy numbers here: [MKLDNN README](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/tutorials/performance/backend/mkldnn/mkldnn_readme.html), [quantization README](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/quantization#1) and [design proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Graph+Optimization+and+Quantization+based+on+subgraph+and+MKL-DNN)

## 1.3.1

### Bug fixes

* [MXNET-953] Fix oob memory read (v1.3.x) / [#13118](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13118)
Simple bugfix addressing an out-of-bounds memory read.


* [MXNET-969] Fix buffer overflow in RNNOp (v1.3.x) / [#13119](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13119)
This fixes an buffer overflow detected by ASAN.


* CudnnFind() usage improvements (v1.3.x) / [#13123](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13123)
  This PR improves the MXNet's use of cudnnFind() to address a few issues:
  1. With the gluon imperative style, cudnnFind() is called during forward(), and so might have its timings perturbed by other GPU activity (including potentially other cudnnFind() calls).
  2. With some cuda drivers versions, care is needed to ensure that the large I/O and workspace cudaMallocs() performed by cudnnFind() are immediately released and available to MXNet.
  3. cudnnFind() makes both conv I/O and workspace allocations that must be covered by the GPU global memory headroom defined by MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_RESERVE. Per issue #12662, large convolutions can result in out-of-memory errors, even when MXNet's storage allocator has free memory in its pool.

  This PR addresses these issues, providing the following benefits:
  1. Consistent algo choice for a given convolution type in a model, both for instances in the same GPU and in other GPUs in a multi-GPU training setting.
  2. Consistent algo choice from run to run, based on eliminating sources of interference of the cudnnFind() timing process.
  3. Consistent model global memory footprint, both because of the consistent algo choice (algo's can have markedly different workspace requirements) and changes to MXNet's use of cudaMalloc.
  4. Increased training performance based on being able to consistently run with models that approach the GPU's full global memory footprint.
  5. Adds a unittest for and solves issue #12662.

* [MXNET-922] Fix memleak in profiler (v1.3.x) / [#13120](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13120)
  Fix a memleak reported locally by ASAN during a normal inference test.

* Fix lazy record io when used with dataloader and multi_worker > 0 (v1.3.x) / [#13124](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13124)
  Fixes multi_worker data loader when record file is used. The MXRecordIO instance needs to require a new file handler after fork to be safely manipulated simultaneously.

  This fix also safely voids the previous temporary fixes #12093 #11370.

* fixed symbols naming in RNNCell, LSTMCell, GRUCell (v1.3.x) / [#13158](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13158)
  This fixes #12783, by assigning all nodes in hybrid_forward a unique name. Some operations were in fact performed without attaching the appropriate (time) prefix to the name, which makes serialized graphs non-deserializable.

* Fixed `__setattr__` method of `_MXClassPropertyMetaClass` (v1.3.x) / [#13157](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13157)
  Fixed `__setattr__` method

* allow foreach on input with 0 length (v1.3.x) / [#13151](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13151)
  Fix #12470. With this change, outs shape can be inferred correctly.

* Infer dtype in SymbolBlock import from input symbol (v1.3.x) / [#13117](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13117)
  Fix for the issue - #11849
  Currently, Gluon symbol block cannot import any symbol with type other than fp32. All the parameters are created as FP32 leading to failure in importing the params when it is of type fp16, fp64 etc,
  In this PR, we infer the type of the symbol being imported and create the Symbol Block Parameters with that inferred type.
  Added the tests

### Documentation fixes

* Document the newly added env variable (v1.3.x) / [#13156](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13156)
  Document the env variable: MXNET_ENFORCE_DETERMINISM added in PR: [#12992](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12992)

* fix broken links (v1.3.x) / [#13155](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13155)
  This PR fixes broken links on the website.

* fix broken Python IO API docs (v1.3.x) / [#13154](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13154)
  Fixes [#12854: Data Iterators documentation is broken](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12854)

  This PR manually specifies members of the IO module so that the docs will render as expected. This is workaround in the docs to deal with a bug introduced in the Python code/structure since v1.3.0. See the comments for more info.

  This PR also fixes another issue that may or may not be related. Cross references to same-named entities like name, shape, or type are confusing Sphinx and it seems to just link to whatever it last dealt with that has the same name, and not the current module. To fix this you have to be very specific. Don't use type, use np.type if that's what you want. Otherwise you might end up with mxnet.kvstore.KVStore.type. This is a known Sphinx issue, so it might be something we have to deal with for the time being.

  This is important for any future modules - that they recognize this issue and make efforts to map the params and other elements.

* add/update infer_range docs (v1.3.x) / [#13153](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13153)
  This PR adds or updates the docs for the infer_range feature.

  Clarifies the param in the C op docs
  Clarifies the param in the Scala symbol docs
  Adds the param for the Scala ndarray docs
  Adds the param for the Python symbol docs
  Adds the param for the Python ndarray docs

### Other Improvements

* [MXNET-1179] Enforce deterministic algorithms in convolution layers (v1.3.x) / [#13152](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13152)
  Some of the CUDNN convolution algorithms are non-deterministic (see issue #11341). This PR adds an env variable to enforce determinism in the convolution operators. If set to true, only deterministic CUDNN algorithms will be used. If no deterministic algorithm is available, MXNet will error out.


### Submodule updates

* update mshadow (v1.3.x) / [#13122](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13122)
  Update mshadow for omp acceleration when nvcc is not present

## 1.3.0

### New Features - Gluon RNN layers are now HybridBlocks
- In this release, Gluon RNN layers such as `gluon.rnn.RNN`, `gluon.rnn.LSTM`, `gluon.rnn.GRU` becomes `HybridBlock`s as part of [gluon.rnn improvements project](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/11) (#11482).
- This is the result of newly available fused RNN operators added for CPU: LSTM([#10104](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10104)), vanilla RNN([#11399](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11399)), GRU([#10311](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10311))
- Now many dynamic networks that are based on Gluon RNN layers can now be completely hybridized, exported, and used in the inference APIs in other language bindings such as R, Scala, etc.

### MKL-DNN improvements
- Introducing more functionality support for MKL-DNN as follows:
  - Added support for more activation functions like, "sigmoid", "tanh", "softrelu". ([#10336](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10336))
  - Added Debugging functionality: Result check ([#12069](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12069)) and Backend switch ([#12058](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12058)).

### New Features - Gluon Model Zoo Pre-trained Models
- Gluon Vision Model Zoo now provides MobileNetV2 pre-trained models (#10879) in addition to
  AlexNet, DenseNet, Inception V3, MobileNetV1, ResNet V1 and V2, SqueezeNet 1.0 and 1.1, and VGG
  pretrained models.
- Updated pre-trained models provide state-of-the-art performance on all resnetv1, resnetv2, and vgg16, vgg19, vgg16_bn, vgg19_bn models (#11327 #11860 #11830).

### New Features - Clojure package (experimental)
- MXNet now supports the Clojure programming language. The MXNet Clojure package brings flexible and efficient GPU computing and state-of-art deep learning to Clojure. It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in Clojure. It also lets you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in Clojure, and apply them to tasks, such as image classification and data science challenges.([#11205](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11205))
- Checkout examples and API documentation [here](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/clojure/index.html).

### New Features - Synchronized Cross-GPU Batch Norm (experimental)
- Gluon now supports Synchronized Batch Normalization (#11502).
- This enables stable training on large-scale networks with high memory consumption such as FCN for image segmentation.

### New Features - Sparse Tensor Support for Gluon (experimental)
- Sparse gradient support is added to `gluon.nn.Embedding`. Set `sparse_grad=True` to enable when constructing the Embedding block. ([#10924](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10924))
- Gluon Parameter now supports "row_sparse" storage type, which reduces communication cost and memory consumption for multi-GPU training for large models. `gluon.contrib.nn.SparseEmbedding` is an example empowered by this. ([#11001](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11001), [#11429](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11429))
- Gluon HybridBlock now supports hybridization with sparse operators ([#11306](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11306)).

### New Features - Control flow operators (experimental)
- This is the first step towards optimizing dynamic neural networks with variable computation graphs, by adding symbolic and imperative control flow operators. [Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Optimize+dynamic+neural+network+models+with+control+flow+operators).
- New operators introduced: foreach([#11531](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11531)), while_loop([#11566](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11566)), cond([#11760](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11760)).

### New Features - Scala API Improvements (experimental)
- Improvements to MXNet Scala API usability([#10660](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10660), [#10787](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10787), [#10991](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10991))
- Symbol.api and NDArray.api would bring new set of functions that have complete definition for all arguments.
- Please see this [Type safe API design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Scala+Type-safe+API+Design+Doc) for more details.

### New Features - Rounding GPU Memory Pool for dynamic networks with variable-length inputs and outputs (experimental)
- MXNet now supports a new memory pool type for GPU memory (#11041).
- Unlike the default memory pool requires exact size match to reuse released memory chunks, this new memory pool uses exponential-linear rounding so that similar sized memory chunks can all be reused, which is more suitable for all the workloads with dynamic-shape inputs and outputs. Set environment variable `MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_TYPE=Round` to enable.

### New Features - Topology-aware AllReduce (experimental)
- This features uses trees to perform the Reduce and Broadcast. It uses the idea of minimum spanning trees to do a binary tree Reduce communication pattern to improve it. This topology aware approach reduces the existing limitations for single machine communication shown by mehods like parameter server and NCCL ring reduction. It is an experimental feature ([#11591](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11591)).
- Paper followed for implementation: [Optimal message scheduling for aggregation](https://www.sysml.cc/doc/178.pdf).
- Set environment variable `MXNET_KVSTORE_USETREE=1` to enable.

### New Features - Export MXNet models to ONNX format (experimental)
- With this feature, now MXNet models can be exported to ONNX format([#11213](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11213)). Currently, MXNet supports ONNX v1.2.1. [API documentation](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/contrib/onnx.html).
- Checkout this [tutorial](https://mxnet.apache.org/tutorials/onnx/export_mxnet_to_onnx.html) which shows how to use MXNet to ONNX exporter APIs. ONNX protobuf so that those models can be imported in other frameworks for inference.

### New Features - TensorRT Runtime Integration (experimental)
- [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) provides significant acceleration of model inference on NVIDIA GPUs compared to running the full graph in MxNet using unfused GPU operators. In addition to faster fp32 inference, TensorRT optimizes fp16 inference, and is capable of int8 inference (provided the quantization steps are performed). Besides increasing throughput, TensorRT significantly reduces inference latency, especially for small batches.
- This feature in MXNet now introduces runtime integration of TensorRT into MXNet, in order to accelerate inference.([#11325](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11325))
- Currently, its in contrib package.

### New Examples - Scala
- Refurnished Scala Examples with improved API, documentation and CI test coverage. ([#11753](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11753), [#11621](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11621) )
- Now all Scala examples have:
  - No bugs block in the middle
  - Good Readme to start with
  - with Type-safe API usage inside
  - monitored in CI in each PR runs

### Maintenance - Flaky Tests improvement effort
- Fixed 130 flaky tests on CI. Tracked progress of the project [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/9).
- Add flakiness checker (#11572)

### Maintenance - MXNet Model Backwards Compatibility Checker
- This tool ([#11626](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11626)) helps in ensuring consistency and sanity while performing inference on the latest version of MXNet using models trained on older versions of MXNet.
- This tool will help in detecting issues earlier in the development cycle which break backwards compatibility on MXNet and would contribute towards ensuring a healthy and stable release of MXNet.

### Maintenance - Integrated testing for "the Straight Dope"
- ["Deep Learning - The Straight Dope"](http://gluon.mxnet.io) is a deep learning book based on Apache MXNet Gluon that are contributed by many Gluon users.
- Now the testing of this book is integrated in the nightly tests.

## 1.2.0
### New Features - Added Scala Inference APIs
- Implemented new [Scala Inference APIs](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNetScalaInferenceAPI) which offer an easy-to-use, Scala Idiomatic and thread-safe high level APIs for performing predictions with deep learning models trained with MXNet (#9678). Implemented a new ImageClassifier class which provides APIs for classification tasks on a Java BufferedImage using a pre-trained model you provide (#10054). Implemented a new ObjectDetector class which provides APIs for object and boundary detections on a Java BufferedImage using a pre-trained model you provide (#10229).

### New Features - Added a Module to Import ONNX models into MXNet
- Implemented a new ONNX module in MXNet which offers an easy to use API to import ONNX models into MXNet's symbolic interface (#9963). Checkout the [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/onnx/super_resolution.py) on how you could use this [API](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/ONNX-MXNet+API+Design) to import ONNX models and perform inference on MXNet. Currently, the ONNX-MXNet Import module is still experimental. Please use it with caution.

### New Features - Added Support for Model Quantization with Calibration
- Implemented model quantization by adopting the [TensorFlow approach](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/quantization) with calibration by borrowing the idea from Nvidia's [TensorRT](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7310-8-bit-inference-with-tensorrt.pdf). The focus of this work is on keeping quantized models (ConvNets for now) inference accuracy loss under control when compared to their corresponding FP32 models. Please see the [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/quantization) on how to quantize a FP32 model with or without calibration (#9552). Currently, the Quantization support is still experimental. Please use it with caution.

### New Features - MKL-DNN Integration
- MXNet now integrates with Intel MKL-DNN to accelerate neural network operators: Convolution, Deconvolution, FullyConnected, Pooling, Batch Normalization, Activation, LRN, Softmax, as well as some common operators: sum and concat (#9677). This integration allows NDArray to contain data with MKL-DNN layouts and reduces data layout conversion to get the maximal performance from MKL-DNN. Currently, the MKL-DNN integration is still experimental. Please use it with caution.

### New Features - Added Exception Handling Support for Operators
- Implemented [Exception Handling Support for Operators](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Improved+exception+handling+in+MXNet) in MXNet. MXNet now transports backend C++ exceptions to the different language front-ends and prevents crashes when exceptions are thrown during operator execution (#9681).

### New Features - Enhanced FP16 support
- Added support for distributed mixed precision training with FP16. It supports storing of master copy of weights in float32 with the multi_precision mode of optimizers (#10183). Improved speed of float16 operations on x86 CPU by 8 times through F16C instruction set. Added support for more operators to work with FP16 inputs (#10125, #10078, #10169). Added a tutorial on using mixed precision with FP16 (#10391).

### New Features - Added Profiling Enhancements
- Enhanced built-in profiler to support native Intel:registered: VTune:tm: Amplifier objects such as Task, Frame, Event, Counter and Marker from both C++ and Python -- which is also visible in the Chrome tracing view(#8972). Added Runtime tracking of symbolic and imperative operators as well as memory and API calls. Added Tracking and dumping of aggregate profiling data. Profiler also no longer affects runtime performance when not in use.

### Breaking Changes
- Changed Namespace for MXNet scala from `ml.dmlc.mxnet` to `org.apache.mxnet` (#10284).
- Changed API for the Pooling operator from `mxnet.symbol.Pooling(data=None, global_pool=_Null, cudnn_off=_Null, kernel=_Null, pool_type=_Null, pooling_convention=_Null, stride=_Null, pad=_Null, name=None, attr=None, out=None, **kwargs)` to  `mxnet.symbol.Pooling(data=None,  kernel=_Null, pool_type=_Null, global_pool=_Null, cudnn_off=_Null, pooling_convention=_Null, stride=_Null, pad=_Null, name=None, attr=None, out=None, **kwargs)`. This is a breaking change when kwargs are not provided since the new api expects the arguments starting from `global_pool` at the fourth position instead of the second position. (#10000).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed tests - Flakiness/Bugs - (#9598, #9951, #10259, #10197, #10136, #10422). Please see: [Tests Improvement Project](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/9)

- Incompatibility in the behavior of MXNet Convolution operator for certain unsupported use cases: Raises an exception when MKLDNN is enabled, fails silently when it is not.
- MXNet convolution generates wrong results for 1-element strides (#10689).
- [Tutorial on fine-tuning an ONNX model](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/v1.2.0/docs/tutorials/onnx/fine_tuning_gluon.md) fails when using cpu context.
- CMake build ignores the `USE_MKLDNN` flag and doesn't build with MKLDNN support even with `-DUSE_MKLDNN=1`. To workaround the issue please see: #10801.
- Linking the dmlc-core library fails with CMake build when building with `USE_OPENMP=OFF`. To workaround the issue, please use the updated CMakeLists in dmlc-core unit tests directory: https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/396.

## 1.0.0
### Performance
  - Enhanced the performance of `sparse.dot` operator.
  - MXNet now automatically set OpenMP to use all available CPU cores to maximize CPU utilization when `NUM_OMP_THREADS` is not set.
  - Unary and binary operators now avoid using OpenMP on small arrays if using OpenMP actually hurts performance due to multithreading overhead.
  - Significantly improved performance of `broadcast_add`, `broadcast_mul`, etc on CPU.
  - Added bulk execution to imperative mode. You can control segment size with `mxnet.engine.bulk`. As a result, the speed of Gluon in hybrid mode is improved, especially on small networks and multiple GPUs.
  - Improved speed for `ctypes` invocation from Python frontend.
### New Features - Gradient Compression [Experimental]
  - Speed up multi-GPU and distributed training by compressing communication of gradients. This is especially effective when training networks with large fully-connected layers. In Gluon this can be activated with `compression_params` in Trainer.
### New Features - Support of NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) [Experimental]
  - Use `kvstore=’nccl’` for (in some cases) faster training on multiple GPUs.
  - Significantly faster than kvstore=’device’ when batch size is small.
  - It is recommended to set environment variable `NCCL_LAUNCH_MODE` to `PARALLEL` when using NCCL version 2.1 or newer.
### New Features - Advanced Indexing [General Availability]
  - NDArray now supports advanced indexing (both slice and assign) as specified by the numpy standard: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html#combining-advanced-and-basic-indexing with the following restrictions:
    - if key is a list type, only a list of integers is supported, e.g. `key=[1, 2]` is supported, while not for `key=[[1, 2]]`.
    - Ellipsis (...) and np.newaxis are not supported.
    - `Boolean` array indexing is not supported.
### New Features - Gluon [General Availability]
  - Performance optimizations discussed above.
  - Added support for loading data in parallel with multiple processes to `gluon.data.DataLoader`. The number of workers can be set with `num_worker`. Does not support windows yet.
  - Added Block.cast to support networks with different data types, e.g. `float16`.
  - Added Lambda block for wrapping a user defined function as a block.
  - Generalized `gluon.data.ArrayDataset` to support arbitrary number of arrays.
### New Features - ARM / Raspberry Pi support [Experimental]
  - MXNet now compiles and runs on ARMv6, ARMv7, ARMv64 including Raspberry Pi devices. See https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/docker_multiarch for more information.
### New Features - NVIDIA Jetson support [Experimental]
  - MXNet now compiles and runs on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 boards with GPU acceleration.
  - You can install the python MXNet package on a Jetson board by running - `$ pip install mxnet-jetson-tx2`.
### New Features - Sparse Tensor Support [General Availability]
  - Added more sparse operators: `contrib.SparseEmbedding`, `sparse.sum` and `sparse.mean`.
  - Added `asscipy()` for easier conversion to scipy.
  - Added `check_format()` for sparse ndarrays to check if the array format is valid.
### Bug-fixes
  - Fixed a[-1] indexing doesn't work on `NDArray`.
  - Fixed `expand_dims` if axis < 0.
  - Fixed a bug that causes topk to produce incorrect result on large arrays.
  - Improved numerical precision of unary and binary operators for `float64` data.
  - Fixed derivatives of log2 and log10. They used to be the same with log.
  - Fixed a bug that causes MXNet to hang after fork. Note that you still cannot use GPU in child processes after fork due to limitations of CUDA.
  - Fixed a bug that causes `CustomOp` to fail when using auxiliary states.
  - Fixed a security bug that is causing MXNet to listen on all available interfaces when running training in distributed mode.
### Doc Updates
  - Added a security best practices document under FAQ section.
  - Fixed License Headers including restoring copyright attributions.
  - Documentation updates.
  - Links for viewing source.

Features such as combining and slicing are planned for the next release. Checkout master to get a preview.
  - Random number generators in `mx.nd.random.*` and `mx.sym.random.*` now support both CPU and GPU.
  - `NDArray` and `Symbol` now supports "fluent" methods. You can now use `x.exp()` etc instead of `mx.nd.exp(x)` or `mx.sym.exp(x)`.
  - Added `mx.rtc.CudaModule` for writing and running CUDA kernels from python.
  - Added `multi_precision` option to optimizer for easier float16 training.
