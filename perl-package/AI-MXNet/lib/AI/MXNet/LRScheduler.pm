    AI::MXNet::LRScheduler - The adaptive scheduler of the learning rate.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Learning rate scheduler, which adaptively changes the learning rate based on the
    progress.

=head2 call

    Call to schedule current learning rate

    The training progress is presented by num_update, which can be roughly
    viewed as the number of minibatches executed so far. Its value is
    non-decreasing, and increases at most by one.

    The exact value is the upper bound of the number of updates applied to
    a weight/index

    See more details in https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/625

    Parameters
    ----------
    $num_update: Int
        the maximal number of updates applied to a weight.
=cut

package AI::MXNet::FactorScheduler;

=head1 NAME

    AI::MXNet::FactorScheduler - Reduces the learning rate by a factor.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Reduces the learning rate by a factor each step.
    Assume the weight has been updated by n times, then the learning rate will
    be base_lr * factor^(floor(n/step))

    Parameters
    ----------
    step: Int
        schedule the learning rate update after n updates
    factor: Num
        the factor by which to reduce the learning rate.

package AI::MXNet::MultiFactorScheduler;

=head1 NAME

    AI::MXNet::MultiFactorScheduler - Reduces the learning rate by an array ref of factors.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Reduces a learning rate in factor at steps specified in an array ref.
    Assume the weight has been updated by n times, then the learning rate will
    be base_lr * factor^(sum((step/n)<=1)) # step is an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    step: ArrayRef[Int]
        schedule learning rate after n updates
    factor: Num
        the factor for reducing the learning rate
