Apache MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.
It allows you to ***mix*** [symbolic and imperative programming](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/architecture/program_model)
to ***maximize*** efficiency and productivity.
At its core, MXNet contains a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly.
A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient.
MXNet is portable and lightweight, scalable to many GPUs and machines.

Apache MXNet is more than a deep learning project. It is a [community](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/master/community)
on a mission of democratizing AI. It is a collection of [blue prints and guidelines](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/architecture/overview)
for building deep learning systems, and interesting insights of DL systems for hackers.

History
-------
MXNet emerged from a collaboration by the authors of [cxxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/cxxnet), [minerva](https://github.com/dmlc/minerva), and [purine2](https://github.com/purine/purine2). The project reflects what we have learned from the past projects. MXNet combines aspects of each of these projects to achieve flexibility, speed, and memory efficiency.
