"""Performance benchmark tests for MXNet NDArray Reduction Operations.
1. Operators are automatically fetched from MXNet operator registry.
2. Default Inputs are generated. See rules/default_params.py. You can override the default values.

Below 10 reduction Operators are covered:

['max', 'max_axis', 'mean', 'min', 'min_axis', 'nanprod', 'nansum', 'prod', 'sum', 'sum_axis']

        Input tensor size to use for tests (if on, dimensions >= 2**32)
    warmup: int, default 25
        Number of times to run for warmup
    runs: int, default 100
        Number of runs to capture benchmark results

    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary of results. Key -> Name of the operator, Value -> Benchmark results.
