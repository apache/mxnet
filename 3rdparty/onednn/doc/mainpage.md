Developer Guide {#dev_guide}
============================

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform
performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
The library is optimized for Intel Architecture Processors, Intel Processor
Graphics and Xe architecture-based Graphics. Support for other architectures
such as Arm\* 64-bit Architecture (AArch64) and OpenPOWER\* Power ISA (PPC64)
is experimental.

oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework
developers interested in improving application performance
on Intel CPUs and GPUs. Deep learning practitioners should use one of the
applications enabled with oneDNN.
