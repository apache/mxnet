    "[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis#History), \n",
    "Legendre first developed the method of least squares regression in 1805,\n",
    "which was shortly thereafter rediscovered by Gauss in 1809. \n",
    "Presumably, Legendre, who had Tweeted about the paper several times,\n",
    "was peeved that Gauss failed to cite his arXiv preprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Legendre](../img/legendre.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Matters of provenance aside, you might wonder - if Legendre and Gauss \n",
    "worked on linear regression, does that mean there were the original deep learning researchers?\n",
    "And if linear regression doesn't wholly belong to deep learning, \n",
    "then why are we presenting a linear model \n",
    "as the first example in a tutorial series on neural networks? \n",
    "Well it turns out that we can express linear regression \n",
    "as the simplest possible (useful) neural network. \n",
    "A neural network is just a collection of nodes (aka neurons) connected by directed edges. \n",
    "In most networks, we arrange the nodes into layers with each feeding its output into the layer above. \n",
    "To calculate the value of any node, we first perform a weighted sum of the inputs (according to weights ``w``) \n",
    "and then apply an *activation function*. \n",
    "For linear regression, we only have two layers, one corresponding to the input (depicted in orange) \n",
    "and a one-node layer (depicted in green) correspnding to the ouput.\n",
    "For the output node the activation function is just the identity function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/onelayer.png)\n",

    "To get going, we will generate a simple synthetic dataset by sampling random data points ``X[i]`` and corresponding labels ``y[i]`` in the following manner. Out inputs will each be sampled from a random normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Our features will be independent. Another way of saying this is that they will have diagonal covariance.  The labels will be generated accoding to the *true* labeling function `y[i] = 2 * X[i][0]- 3.4 * X[i][1] + 4.2 + noise` where the noise is drawn from a random gaussian with mean ``0`` and variance ``.01``.

    "In the succeeding chapters, we'll introduce more realistic data, fancier models, more complicated loss functions, and more. But the core ideas are the same and the training loop will look remarkably familiar. Because these tutorials are self-contained, you'll get to know this ritual quite well. In addition to updating out model, we'll often want to do some bookkeeping. Among other things, we might want to keep track of training progress and visualize it graphically. We demonstrate one slighly more sophisticated training loop below."

In the following tutorials, we'll build on this foundation, introducing the basic ideas behind modern neural networks and demonstrating the powerful abstractions in MXNet's `gluon` package for building complex models with little code.
