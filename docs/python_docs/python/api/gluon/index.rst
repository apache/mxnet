mxnet.gluon
===========

The Gluon library in Apache MXNet provides a clear, concise, and simple API for deep learning.
It makes it easy to prototype, build, and train deep learning models without sacrificing training speed.

Example
-------

The following example shows how you might create a simple neural network with three layers:
one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.

.. code-block:: python

   net = gluon.nn.Sequential()
   # When instantiated, Sequential stores a chain of neural network layers.
   # Once presented with data, Sequential executes each layer in turn, using
   # the output of one layer as the input for the next
   net.add(gluon.nn.Dense(256, activation="relu")) # 1st layer (256 nodes)
   net.add(gluon.nn.Dense(256, activation="relu")) # 2nd hidden layer
   net.add(gluon.nn.Dense(num_outputs))


.. automodule:: mxnet.gluon
