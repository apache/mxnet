Mathematical functions
**********************

.. currentmodule:: mxnet.np

.. note::

   Currently, most of the math functions only support inputs and outputs of the same dtype.
   This limitation usually results in imprecise outputs for ndarrays with integral dtype
   while floating-point values are expected in the output.
   Appropriate handling of ndarrays integral dtypes is in active development.
