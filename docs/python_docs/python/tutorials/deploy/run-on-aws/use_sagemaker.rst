Run on Amazon SageMaker
-----------------------

This chapter will give a high level overview about running MXNet on Amazon SageMaker,
in-depth tutorials can be found on the `Sagemaker
website <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html>`__.

SageMaker offers Jupyter notebooks and supports MXNet out-of-the box.
You can run your notebooks on CPU instances and as such profit from the
free tier. However, more powerful CPU instances or GPU instances are
charged by time. Within this notebook you can `fetch, explore and
prepare training
data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-notebooks-instances.html>`__.

With your own data on the notebook instance, you can easily launch training via the SageMaker
SDK. So there is no need to manually configure and log into EC2
instances. You can either bring your own model or use SageMaker's
`built-in
algorithms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html>`__
that are tailored to specific use cases such as computer vision, NLP
etc. SageMaker encapsulates the process of training into the class
``Estimator`` and we can now start the training on the local notebook
instance:

::

    from sagemaker.mxnet import MXNet as MXNetEstimator
    estimator = MXNetEstimator(entry_point='train.py',
                               role=sagemaker.get_execution_role(),
                               train_instance_count=1,
                               train_instance_type='local',
                               hyperparameters={'batch_size': 1024,
                                                'epochs': 30})
    estimator.fit(inputs)

If you require a more powerful platform for training, then you only need
to change the ``train_instance_type``. Once you call fit, SageMaker will
automatically create the required EC2 instances, train your model within
a Docker container and then immediately shutdown these instances.
``Fit()`` requires an entry point (here ``train.py``) that describes the
model and training loop. This script needs to provides certain
functions, that will be automatically called by SageMaker once you train
and deploy the model. More information about the entry point script can
be found
`here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/mxnet-training-inference-code-template.html>`__.
When the model is ready for deployment you can use `SageMaker's hosting
services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-hosting.html>`__
that create an HTTPS endpoint where model inference is provided.

::

    predictor = estimator.deploy(initial_instance_count=1,
                                 instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge')
