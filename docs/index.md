# MXNet.jl

MXNet.jl is the [dmlc/mxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) [Julia](http://julialang.org/) package. MXNet.jl brings flexible and efficient GPU computing and state-of-art deep learning to Julia. Some highlight of features include:

* Efficient tensor/matrix computation across multiple devices, including multiple CPUs, GPUs and distributed server nodes.
* Flexible symbolic manipulation to composite and construct state-of-the-art deep learning models.

To install MXNet.jl, please follow the [installaton guide](user-guide/install.md). See the navigation menu in the sidebar for an [overview](user-guide/overview.md) of MXNet.jl and tutorials on training neural networks in MXNet.jl.
