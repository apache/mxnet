MXNet is available on several cloud providers with GPU support. You can also
find GPU/CPU-hybrid support for use cases like scalable inference, or even
fractional GPU support with AWS Elastic Inference.

**WARNING**: the following cloud provider packages are provided for your convenience
but they point to packages that are *not* provided nor endorsed by the Apache
Software Foundation. As such, they might contain software components with more
restrictive licenses than the Apache License and you'll need to decide whether
they are appropriate for your usage. Like all Apache Releases, the official
Apache MXNet (incubating) releases consist of source code only and are found at
the [Download page](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/download).
