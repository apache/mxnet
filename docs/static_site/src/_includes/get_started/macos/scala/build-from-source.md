Prebuilt binaries distributed via Maven have been removed as they redistributed
Category-X binaries in violation of Apache Software Foundation (ASF) policies.
If you would like to help re-do the binary releases in an ASF-compliant manner,
please reach out via one of the [developer communications
channels](https://mxnet.apache.org/community/contribute#mxnet-dev-communications).
Until then, please follow the build from source instructions linked below.
