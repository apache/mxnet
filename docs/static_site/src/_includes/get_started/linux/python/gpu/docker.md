**WARNING**: the following links and names of binary distributions are provided for
your convenience but they point to packages that are *not* provided nor endorsed
by the Apache Software Foundation. As such, they might contain software
components with more restrictive licenses than the Apache License and you'll
need to decide whether they are appropriate for your usage. The packages linked
here contain proprietary parts of the NVidia CUDA SDK and GPL GCC Runtime
Library components. Like all Apache Releases, the official Apache MXNet
releases consist of source code only and are found at the [Download
page](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/download).

Docker images with *MXNet* are available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mxnet/).

Please follow the [NVidia Docker installation
instructions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki) to enable the usage
of GPUs from the docker containers.

After you installed Docker on your machine, you can use them via:

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker pull mxnet/python:gpu # Use sudo if you skip Step 2
{% endhighlight %}

You can list docker images to see if mxnet/python docker image pull was successful.

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker images # Use sudo if you skip Step 2

REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
mxnet/python gpu 493b2683c269 3 weeks ago 4.77 GB
{% endhighlight %}

You can then <a href="/get_started/validate_mxnet.html">validate the installation</a>.
