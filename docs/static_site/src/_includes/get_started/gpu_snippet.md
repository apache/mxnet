CUDA should be installed first.

**Important:** Make sure your installed CUDA version matches the CUDA version in the pip package.

Check your CUDA version with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
nvcc --version
{% endhighlight %}

You can either upgrade your CUDA install or install the MXNet package that supports your CUDA version.
