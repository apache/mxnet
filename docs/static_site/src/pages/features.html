    <div class="col-5">
        <p class="feature-paragraph">The Gluon Python API lets you use MXNet in a fully imperative manner. It also
            allows you to simply switch to
            symbolic mode by calling the <a
                    href="/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/blocks/hybridize.html">hybridize</a>
            functionality. The symbolic execution provides faster and more optimized
            execution as well as the ability to export the network for inference in different language bindings like
            java or C++.

        <p class="feature-paragraph">Deep integration into Python and support for Scala, Julia, Clojure, Java, C++, R
            and Perl.
            Combined with the hybridization feature, this allows a very smooth transition from Python training to
            deployment
            in the language of your choice to shorten the time to production.
