                <p>A <a href="https://d2l.ai">deep learning book</a> with interactive jupyter notebooks, math formula,
                    and a dedicated forum for discussions.</p>
                <p>It offers an interactive learning experience with mathematics, figures, code, text, and discussions,
                    where concepts and techniques are illustrated and implemented with experiments on real data
                    sets.</p>
                <p>Each section is an executable Jupyter notebook. You can modify the code and tune hyperparameters to
                    get instant feedback to accumulate practical experiences in deep learning.</p>
