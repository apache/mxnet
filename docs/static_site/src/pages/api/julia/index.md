# MXNet - Julia API


MXNet supports the Julia programming language. The MXNet Julia package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and the state-of-art deep learning to Julia.

- It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in Julia.
- It also enables you to construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in Julia,
  and apply them to tasks such as image classification and data science challenges.
