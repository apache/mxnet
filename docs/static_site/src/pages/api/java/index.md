# MXNet - Java Inference API

MXNet supports Java for performing inference on a trained model. The MXNet Java Inference API is an extension of the [Scala Infer API]({{'/api/scala/docs/api/#org.apache.mxnet.infer.package'|relative_url}}) which provides model loading and inference functionality.
The goal of the MXNet Java package is to provide an efficient and easy to use inference API.
The MXNet Java package makes it easy to quickly deploy an existing model into a production level Java ecosystem.

## Installation
Please see the [Get Started]({{'/get_started'|relative_url}}) page.

## Tutorials
See the [Java tutorial page]({{'/api/java/docs/tutorials'|relative_url}}) for detailed tutorials and examples using the Java Inference API.

## Java Inference API Reference
The [Java Infer API javadocs]({{'/api/java/docs/api/#org.apache.mxnet.infer.javaapi.package'|relative_url}}) provides detailed API information.
