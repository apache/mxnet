# Using MXNet with Large Tensor Support

## What is large tensor support?
When creating a network that uses large amounts of data, as in a deep graph problem, you may need large tensor support. This means tensors are indexed using INT64, instead of INT32 indices.

This feature is enabled when MXNet is built with a flag *USE_INT64_TENSOR_SIZE=1*, which is now a default setting. You can also make MXNet use INT32 indices by changing this flag.

## When do you need it?
1. When you are creating NDArrays of size larger than 2^31 elements.
2. When the input to your model requires tensors that have inputs larger than 2^31 (when you load them all at once in your code) or attributes greater than 2^31.

## How to identify that you need to use large tensors ?
When you see one of the following errors:


1. OverflowError: unsigned int is greater than maximum
2. Check failed: inp->shape().Size() < 1 >> 31 (4300000000 vs. 0) : Size of tensor you are trying to allocate is larger than 2^32 elements. Please build with flag USE_INT64_TENSOR_SIZE=1
3. Invalid Parameter format for end expect int or None but value='2150000000', in operator slice_axis(name="", end="2150000000", begin="0", axis="0"). *_Basically input attribute was expected to be int32, which is less than 2^31 and the received value is larger than that so, operator's parmeter inference treats that as a string which becomes unexpected input.`_*

## How to use it ?
You can create a large NDArray that requires large tensor enabled build to run as follows:

```python
LARGE_X=4300000000
a = mx.nd.arange(0, LARGE_X, dtype=“int64”)
or
a = nd.ones(shape=LARGE_X)
or
a = nd.empty(LARGE_X)
or
a = nd.random.exponential(shape=LARGE_X)
or
a = nd.random.gamma(shape=LARGE_X)
or
a = nd.random.normal(shape=LARGE_X)
```

## Caveats
1. Use `int64` as `dtype` whenever attempting to slice an NDArray when range is over maximum `int32` value
2. Use `int64` as `dtype` when passing indices as parameters or expecting output as parameters to and from operators

The following are the cases for large tensor usage where you must specify `dtype` as `int64`:


* _randint():_

```python
low_large_value = 2**32
high_large_value = 2**34
# dtype is explicitly specified since default type is int32 for randint
a = nd.random.randint(low_large_value, high_large_value, dtype=np.int64)
```

* _ravel_multi_index()_ and _unravel_index()_:

```python
x1, y1 = rand_coord_2d((LARGE_X - 100), LARGE_X, 10, SMALL_Y)
x2, y2 = rand_coord_2d((LARGE_X - 200), LARGE_X, 9, SMALL_Y)
x3, y3 = rand_coord_2d((LARGE_X - 300), LARGE_X, 8, SMALL_Y)
indices_2d = [[x1, x2, x3], [y1, y2, y3]]
# dtype is explicitly specified for indices else they will default to float32
idx = mx.nd.ravel_multi_index(mx.nd.array(indices_2d, dtype=np.int64),
                                  shape=(LARGE_X, SMALL_Y))
indices_2d = mx.nd.unravel_index(mx.nd.array(idx_numpy, dtype=np.int64),
                                  shape=(LARGE_X, SMALL_Y))
```

* _argsort()_ and _topk()_

They both return indices which are specified by `dtype=np.int64`.

```python
b = create_2d_tensor(rows=LARGE_X, columns=SMALL_Y)
# argsort
s = nd.argsort(b, axis=0, is_ascend=False, dtype=np.int64)
# topk
k = nd.topk(b, k=10, axis=0, dtype=np.int64)
```

* _index_copy()_

Again whenever we are passing indices as arguments and using large tensor, the `dtype` of indices must be `int64`.

```python
x = mx.nd.zeros((LARGE_X, SMALL_Y))
t = mx.nd.arange(1, SMALL_Y + 1).reshape((1, SMALL_Y))
# explicitly specifying dtype of indices to np.int64
index = mx.nd.array([LARGE_X - 1], dtype="int64")
x = mx.nd.contrib.index_copy(x, index, t)
```

* _one_hot()_

Here again array is used as indices that act as location of bits inside the large vector that need to be activated.

```python
# a is the index array here whose dtype should be int64.
a = nd.array([1, (VLARGE_X - 1)], dtype=np.int64)
b = nd.one_hot(a, VLARGE_X)
```

## What platforms and version of MXNet are supported ?
You can use MXNet with large tensor support in the following configuration:

*MXNet built for CPU on Linux (Ubuntu or Amazon Linux), and only for python bindings.*
*Custom wheels are provided with this configuration.*

These flavors of MXNet are currently built with large tensor support:

1. MXNet for linux-cpu
2. MXNet for linux_cu100

Large tensor support only works for *forward pass*. 
Backward pass is partially supported and not completely tested, so it is considered experimental at best.

Not supported:

* GPU. 
* Windows, ARM or any operating system other than Ubuntu
* Other language bindings like Scala, Java, R,  and Julia.


## Other known Issues:
* Randint operator is flaky: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16172.
* dgemm operations using BLAS libraries currently don’t support int64.
* linspace() is not supported.

```python
a = mx.sym.Variable('a')
b = mx.sym.Variable('b')
c = 2 * a + b
texec = c.bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': nd.arange(0, LARGE_X * 2, dtype='int64').reshape(2, LARGE_X), 'b' : nd.arange(0, LARGE_X * 2, dtype='int64').reshape(2, LARGE_X)})
new_shape = {'a': (1, 2*LARGE_X), 'b': (1, 2*LARGE_X)}
texec.reshape(allow_up_sizing=True, **new_shape)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/ubuntu/incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/executor.py", line 449, in reshape
    py_array('i', provided_arg_shape_data)),
OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum}
```

Symbolic reshape is not supported. Please see the following example.

```python
a = mx.sym.Variable('a')
b = mx.sym.Variable('b')
c = 2 * a + b
texec = c.bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': nd.arange(0, LARGE_X * 2, dtype='int64').reshape(2, LARGE_X), 'b' : nd.arange(0, LARGE_X * 2, dtype='int64').reshape(2, LARGE_X)})
new_shape = {'a': (1, 2 * LARGE_X), 'b': (1, 2 * LARGE_X)}
texec.reshape(allow_up_sizing=True, **new_shape)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/ubuntu/incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/executor.py", line 449, in reshape
    py_array('i', provided_arg_shape_data)),
OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum
```

## Working DGL Example(dgl.ai)
The following is a sample running code for DGL which works with int64 but not with int32.

```python
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import gluon
import dgl
import dgl.function as fn
import numpy as np
from scipy import sparse as spsp

num_nodes = 10000000
num_edges = 100000000

col1 = np.random.randint(0, num_nodes, size=(num_edges,))
print('create col1')
col2 = np.random.randint(0, num_nodes, size=(num_edges,))
print('create col2')
data = np.ones((num_edges,))
print('create data')
spm = spsp.coo_matrix((data, (col1, col2)), shape=(num_nodes, num_nodes))
print('create coo')
labels = mx.nd.random.randint(0, 10, shape=(num_nodes,))

g = dgl.DGLGraph(spm, readonly=True)
print('create DGLGraph')
g.ndata['h'] = mx.nd.random.uniform(shape=(num_nodes, 200))
print('create node data')

class node_update(gluon.Block):
    def __init__(self, out_feats):
        super(node_update, self).__init__()
        self.dense = gluon.nn.Dense(out_feats, 'relu')
        self.dropout = 0.5

    def forward(self, nodes):
        h = mx.nd.concat(nodes.data['h'], nodes.data['accum'], dim=1)
        h = self.dense(h)
        return {'h': mx.nd.Dropout(h, p=self.dropout)}
update_fn = node_update(200)
update_fn.initialize(ctx=mx.cpu())

g.update_all(fn.copy_src(src='h', out='m'), fn.sum(msg='m', out='accum'), update_fn)
print('update all')

loss_fcn = gluon.loss.SoftmaxCELoss()
loss = loss_fcn(g.ndata['h'], labels)
print('loss')
loss = loss.sum()
print(loss)
```
