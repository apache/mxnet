## Create a Dataset Using RecordIO

RecordIO implements a file format for a sequence of records. We recommend storing images as records and packing them together. The benefits include:

* Storing images in a compact format--e.g., JPEG, for records--greatly reduces the size of the dataset on the disk.
* Packing data together allows continuous reading on the disk.
* RecordIO has a simple way to partition, simplifying distributed setting. We provide an example later.

We provide two tools for creating a RecordIO dataset.

* [im2rec.cc](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/tools/im2rec.cc) - implements the tool using the C++ API.
* [im2rec.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tools/im2rec.py) - implements the tool using the Python API.

Both provide the same output: a RecordIO dataset.

### Prerequisites

Download the data. You don't need to resize the images manually. You can use ```im2rec``` to resize them automatically. For details, see the "Extension: Using Multiple Labels for a Single Image," later in this topic.

### Step 1. Make an Image List File

* Note that the im2rec.py provides a param `--list` to generate the list for you, but im2rec.cc doesn't support it.

After you download the data, you need to make an image list file.  The format is:

```
integer_image_index \t label_index \t path_to_image
```
Typically, the program takes the list of names of all of the images, shuffles them, then separates them into two lists: a training filename list and a testing filename list. Write the list in the right format.
This is an example file:

```bash
95099  464.000000     n04467665_17283.JPEG
10025081        412.000000     ILSVRC2010_val_00025082.JPEG
74181   789.000000     n01915811_2739.JPEG
10035553        859.000000     ILSVRC2010_val_00035554.JPEG
10048727        929.000000     ILSVRC2010_val_00048728.JPEG
94028   924.000000     n01980166_4956.JPEG
1080682 650.000000     n11807979_571.JPEG
972457  633.000000     n07723039_1627.JPEG
7534    11.000000      n01630670_4486.JPEG
1191261 249.000000     n12407079_5106.JPEG
```

### Step 2. Create the Binary File

To generate a binary image, use `im2rec` in the tool folder. `im2rec` takes the path of the `image list file` you generated, the `root path` of the images, and the `output file path` as input. This process usually takes several hours, so be patient.

Sample command:

```bash
./bin/im2rec image.lst image_root_dir output.bin resize=256
```
For more details, run ```./bin/im2rec```.

### Extension: Multiple Labels for a Single Image

The `im2rec` tool and `mx.io.ImageRecordIter` have multi-label support for a single image.
For example, if you have four labels for a single image, you can use the following procedure to use the RecordIO tools.

1. Write the image list files as follows:

```
integer_image_index \t label_1 \t label_2 \t   label_3 \t label_4 \t path_to_image
```

2. Run `im2rec`, adding a 'label_width=4' to the command argument, for example:

```bash
./bin/im2rec image.lst image_root_dir output.bin resize=256 label_width=4
```

3. In the iterator generation code, set `label_width=4` and `path_imglist=<<The PATH TO YOUR image.lst>>`, for example:

```python
dataiter = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(
  path_imgrec="data/cifar/train.rec",
  data_shape=(3,28,28),
  path_imglist="data/cifar/image.lst",
  label_width=4
)
```
