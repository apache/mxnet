\name{mx.nd.argmin}
\alias{mx.nd.argmin}
\title{Returns indices of the minimum values along an axis.}
\arguments{
\item{data}{NDArray-or-Symbol
The input}

\item{axis}{int or None, optional, default='None'
The axis along which to perform the reduction. Negative values means indexing from right to left. ``Requires axis to be set as int, because global reduction is not supported yet.``}

\item{keepdims}{boolean, optional, default=0
If this is set to `True`, the reduced axis is left in the result as dimension with size one.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.ndarray
}
\description{
In the case of multiple occurrences of minimum values, the indices corresponding to the first occurrence
are returned.
}
\details{
Examples::

x = [[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
       [ 3.,  4.,  5.]]

// argmin along axis 0
  argmin(x, axis=0) = [ 0.,  0.,  0.]

// argmin along axis 1
  argmin(x, axis=1) = [ 0.,  0.]

// argmin along axis 1 keeping same dims as an input array
  argmin(x, axis=1, keepdims=True) = [[ 0.],
                                      [ 0.]]
