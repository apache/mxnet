\alias{mx.symbol.squeeze}
\title{squeeze:Remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array.
Same behavior of defining the output tensor shape as numpy.squeeze for the most of cases.
See the following note for exception.}
\usage{
mx.symbol.squeeze(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{NDArray-or-Symbol[]
data to squeeze}

\item{axis}{Shape or None, optional, default=None
Selects a subset of the single-dimensional entries in the shape. If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than one, an error is raised.}

\item{name}{string, optional
Name of the resulting symbol.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.symbol
}
\description{
Examples::
}
\details{
data = [[[0], [1], [2]]]
  squeeze(data) = [0, 1, 2]
  squeeze(data, axis=0) = [[0], [1], [2]]
  squeeze(data, axis=2) = [[0, 1, 2]]
  squeeze(data, axis=(0, 2)) = [0, 1, 2]

.. Note::
  The output of this operator will keep at least one dimension not removed. For example,
  squeeze([[[4]]]) = [4], while in numpy.squeeze, the output will become a scalar.
