\description{
The logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, is computed as
:math:`\frac{1}{1+exp(-\textbf{x})}`.
}
\details{
Commonly, the sigmoid is used to squash the real-valued output of a linear model
:math:`wTx+b` into the [0,1] range so that it can be interpreted as a probability.
It is suitable for binary classification or probability prediction tasks.

.. note::
   Use the LogisticRegressionOutput as the final output layer of a net.

The storage type of ``label`` can be ``default`` or ``csr``

- LogisticRegressionOutput(default, default) = default
- LogisticRegressionOutput(default, csr) = default

The loss function used is the Binary Cross Entropy Loss:

:math:`-{(y\log(p) + (1 - y)\log(1 - p))}`

Where `y` is the ground truth probability of positive outcome for a given example, and `p` the probability predicted by the model. By default, gradients of this loss function are scaled by factor `1/m`, where m is the number of regression outputs of a training example.
The parameter `grad_scale` can be used to change this scale to `grad_scale/m`.
