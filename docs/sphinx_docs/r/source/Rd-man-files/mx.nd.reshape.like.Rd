\title{Reshape some or all dimensions of `lhs` to have the same shape as some or all dimensions of `rhs`.}
\arguments{
\item{lhs}{NDArray-or-Symbol
First input.}

\item{rhs}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Second input.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.ndarray
}
\description{
Returns a **view** of the `lhs` array with a new shape without altering any data.
}
\details{
Example::

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  y = [[0, -4], [3, 2], [2, 2]]
  reshape_like(x, y) = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

More precise control over how dimensions are inherited is achieved by specifying \
slices over the `lhs` and `rhs` array dimensions. Only the sliced `lhs` dimensions \
are reshaped to the `rhs` sliced dimensions, with the non-sliced `lhs` dimensions staying the same.

Examples::

- lhs shape = (30,7), rhs shape = (15,2,4), lhs_begin=0, lhs_end=1, rhs_begin=0, rhs_end=2, output shape = (15,2,7)
  - lhs shape = (3, 5), rhs shape = (1,15,4), lhs_begin=0, lhs_end=2, rhs_begin=1, rhs_end=2, output shape = (15)

Negative indices are supported, and `None` can be used for either `lhs_end` or `rhs_end` to indicate the end of the range.

Example::

- lhs shape = (30, 12), rhs shape = (4, 2, 2, 3), lhs_begin=-1, lhs_end=None, rhs_begin=1, rhs_end=None, output shape = (30, 2, 2, 3)
