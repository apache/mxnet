\description{
Normalizes a data batch by mean and variance, and applies a scale ``gamma`` as
well as offset ``beta``.
}
\details{
Assume the input has more than one dimension and we normalize along axis 1.
We first compute the mean and variance along this axis:

.. math::

data\_mean[i] = mean(data[:,i,:,...]) \\
  data\_var[i] = var(data[:,i,:,...])

Then compute the normalized output, which has the same shape as input, as following:

.. math::

out[:,i,:,...] = \frac{data[:,i,:,...] - data\_mean[i]}{\sqrt{data\_var[i]+\epsilon}} * gamma[i] + beta[i]

Both *mean* and *var* returns a scalar by treating the input as a vector.

Assume the input has size *k* on axis 1, then both ``gamma`` and ``beta``
have shape *(k,)*. If ``output_mean_var`` is set to be true, then outputs both ``data_mean`` and
the inverse of ``data_var``, which are needed for the backward pass. Note that gradient of these
two outputs are blocked.

Besides the inputs and the outputs, this operator accepts two auxiliary
states, ``moving_mean`` and ``moving_var``, which are *k*-length
vectors. They are global statistics for the whole dataset, which are updated
by::

moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + data_mean * (1 - momentum)
  moving_var = moving_var * momentum + data_var * (1 - momentum)

If ``use_global_stats`` is set to be true, then ``moving_mean`` and
``moving_var`` are used instead of ``data_mean`` and ``data_var`` to compute
the output. It is often used during inference.

The parameter ``axis`` specifies which axis of the input shape denotes
the 'channel' (separately normalized groups).  The default is 1.  Specifying -1 sets the channel
axis to be the last item in the input shape.

Both ``gamma`` and ``beta`` are learnable parameters. But if ``fix_gamma`` is true,
then set ``gamma`` to 1 and its gradient to 0.

Note::

When fix_gamma is set to True, no sparse support is provided. If fix_gamma is set to False,
the sparse tensors will fallback.
