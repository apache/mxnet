\item{data}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Input ndarray}

\item{label}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Ground-truth labels for the loss.}

\item{data.lengths}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Lengths of data for each of the samples. Only required when use_data_lengths is true.}

\item{label.lengths}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Lengths of labels for each of the samples. Only required when use_label_lengths is true.}

\item{use.data.lengths}{boolean, optional, default=0
Whether the data lenghts are decided by `data_lengths`. If false, the lengths are equal to the max sequence length.}

\item{use.label.lengths}{boolean, optional, default=0
Whether the label lenghts are decided by `label_lengths`, or derived from `padding_mask`. If false, the lengths are derived from the first occurrence of the value of `padding_mask`. The value of `padding_mask` is ``0`` when first CTC label is reserved for blank, and ``-1`` when last label is reserved for blank. See `blank_label`.}

\item{blank.label}{{'first', 'last'},optional, default='first'
Set the label that is reserved for blank label.If "first", 0-th label is reserved, and label values for tokens in the vocabulary are between ``1`` and ``alphabet_size-1``, and the padding mask is ``-1``. If "last", last label value ``alphabet_size-1`` is reserved for blank label instead, and label values for tokens in the vocabulary are between ``0`` and ``alphabet_size-2``, and the padding mask is ``0``.}

\details{
The shapes of the inputs and outputs:

- **data**: `(sequence_length, batch_size, alphabet_size)`
- **label**: `(batch_size, label_sequence_length)`
- **out**: `(batch_size)`

The `data` tensor consists of sequences of activation vectors (without applying softmax),
with i-th channel in the last dimension corresponding to i-th label
for i between 0 and alphabet_size-1 (i.e always 0-indexed).
Alphabet size should include one additional value reserved for blank label.
When `blank_label` is ``"first"``, the ``0``-th channel is be reserved for
activation of blank label, or otherwise if it is "last", ``(alphabet_size-1)``-th channel should be
reserved for blank label.

``label`` is an index matrix of integers. When `blank_label` is ``"first"``,
the value 0 is then reserved for blank label, and should not be passed in this matrix. Otherwise,
when `blank_label` is ``"last"``, the value `(alphabet_size-1)` is reserved for blank label.

If a sequence of labels is shorter than *label_sequence_length*, use the special
padding value at the end of the sequence to conform it to the correct
length. The padding value is `0` when `blank_label` is ``"first"``, and `-1` otherwise.

For example, suppose the vocabulary is `[a, b, c]`, and in one batch we have three sequences
'ba', 'cbb', and 'abac'. When `blank_label` is ``"first"``, we can index the labels as
`{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`, and we reserve the 0-th channel for blank label in data tensor.
The resulting `label` tensor should be padded to be::

[[2, 1, 0, 0], [3, 2, 2, 0], [1, 2, 1, 3]]

When `blank_label` is ``"last"``, we can index the labels as
`{'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}`, and we reserve the channel index 3 for blank label in data tensor.
The resulting `label` tensor should be padded to be::

[[1, 0, -1, -1], [2, 1, 1, -1], [0, 1, 0, 2]]

``out`` is a list of CTC loss values, one per example in the batch.
