## Propose an improvement or a new feature
Our community is constantly looking for feedback to improve Apache MXNet. If you have an idea how to improve MXNet or have a new feature in mind that would be beneficial for MXNet users, please open an issue in [MXNet’s JIRA](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNet). The improvement or new feature should be described in appropriate detail and include the scope and its requirements if possible. Detailed information is important for a few reasons:<br/>
- It ensures your requirements are met when the improvement or feature is implemented.<br/> 
- It helps to estimate the effort and to design a solution that addresses your needs. <br/>
- It allows for constructive discussions that might arise around this issue.

Detailed information is also required, if you plan to contribute the improvement or feature you proposed yourself. Please read the [contributions](http://mxnet.io/community/contribute.html) guide in this case as well.
