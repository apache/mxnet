# CNN Text Classification Example for Scala
This is the example using Scala type-safe api doing CNN text classification. 
This example is only for Illustration and not modeled to achieve the best accuracy.

Please contribute to improve the dev accuracy of the model.

## Setup

Please configure your maven project using our latest release. An tutorial to do that can be found here:
[IntelliJ IDE (or alternative IDE) project setup](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/scala/docs/tutorials/mxnet_scala_on_intellij)

### Download the training files
```$xslt

https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mxnet-scala/scala-example-ci/CNN/rt-polarity.neg
```
### Download pretrained Word2Vec Model
I used the SLIM version, you can try with the full version to see if the accuracy can improve
```$xslt
https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mxnet-scala/scala-example-ci/CNN/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300-SLIM.bin
```
### Train the model
Please configure the [args](https://github.com/apache/mxnet/blob/scala-package/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/mxnet/examples/cnntextclassification/CNNTextClassification.scala#L299-L312) required for the model here and then run it.
