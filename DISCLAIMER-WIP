Apache MXNet is an effort undergoing incubation at
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating project’s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF policy.
For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing conditions.
What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently aware of
(note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

1. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17329
2. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15547
3. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15569

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project,
please be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review
to determine the overall implications of including this work.
