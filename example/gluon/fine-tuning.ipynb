    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, \n",
    "we demonstrated how to train a neural network \n",
    "to recognize the categories corresponding to objects in images.\n",
    "We looked at toy datasets like hand-written digits,\n",
    "and thumbnail-sized pictures of animals. \n",
    "And we talked about the ImageNet dataset, \n",
    "the default academic benchmark,\n",
    "which contains 1M million images,\n",
    "1000 each from 1000 separate classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ImageNet dataset categorically changed what was possible in computer vision.\n",
    "It turns out some things are possible (these days, even easy) \n",
    "on gigantic datasets, that simply aren't with smaller datasets.\n",
    "In fact, we don't know of any technique that can comparably powerful model\n",
    "on a similar photograph dataset but containing only, say, 10k images.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's a problem. \n",
    "Because however impressive the results of CNNs on ImageNet may be,\n",
    "most people aren't interested in ImageNet itself.\n",
    "They're interested in their own problems.\n",
    "Recognize people based on pictures of their faces.\n",
    "Distinguish between photographs of $10$ different types of coral on the ocean floor. \n",
    "Usually when individuals (and not Amazon, Google, or inter-institutional *big science* initiatives)\n",
    "are interested in solving a computer vision problem,\n",
    "they come to the table with modestly sized datasets. \n",
    "A few hundred examples may be common and a few thousand examples may be as much as you can reasonably ask for.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one natural question emerges.\n",
    "Can we somehow use the powerful models trained on millions of examples for one dataset,\n",
    "and apply them to improve performance on a new problem \n",
    "with a much smaller dataset?\n",
    "This kind of problem (learning on source dataset, bringing knowledge to target dataset),\n",
    "is appropriately called *transfer learning*. \n",
    "Fortunately, we have some effective tools for solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For deep neural networks, the most popular approach is called finetuning\n",
    "and the idea is both simple and effective:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train a neural network on the source task $S$.\n",
    "* Decapitate it, replacing it's output layer appropriate to target task $T$.\n",
    "* Initialize the weights on the new output layer randomly, keeping all other (pretrained) weights the same.\n",

    "or of training on ImageNet from scratch,\n",
    "we'll pull the weights of the pretrained Squeeze net from the internet.\n",
    "Specifically, we'll be fine-tuning a squeezenet-1.1 \n",
