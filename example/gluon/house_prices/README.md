# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This example shows how to predict house prices and it is based on the [House Price Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques#description)

First you need to download train and test data set from here:
```
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/download/train.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/download/test.csv
```
Afterwards you can execute the script with  ```python kaggle_k_fold_cross_validation.py```

For a detailed explanation of the code, you can check out this [chapter](http://d2l.ai/chapter_deep-learning-basics/kaggle-house-price.html) of the Dive into Deep Learning book.
