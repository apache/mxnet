Recurrent Neural Network Examples
===========

For more current implementations of NLP and RNN models with MXNet, please visit [gluon-nlp](http://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/index.html)

------


This directory contains functions for creating recurrent neural networks
models using high level mxnet.rnn interface.

Here is a short overview of what is in this directory.

Directory | What's in it?
--- | ---
`word_lm/` | Language model trained on the Sherlock Holmes dataset achieving state of the art performance
`bucketing/` | Language model with bucketing API with python
`bucket_R/` | Language model with bucketing API with R
