If you want to contribute to this list and the examples, please open a new pull request.


### Examples

Example applications or scripts should be submitted in this `example` folder.


### Tutorials

If you have a tutorial idea for the website, download the [Jupyter notebook tutorial template](https://github.com/apache/mxnet/tree/master/example/MXNetTutorialTemplate.ipynb).

#### Tutorial location

Notebook tutorials should be submitted in the `docs/tutorials` folder, so that they maybe rendered in the [web site's tutorial section](https://mxnet.apache.org/tutorials/index.html).

Do not forget to udpdate the `docs/tutorials/index.md` for your tutorial to show up on the website.

#### Tutorial formatting

The site expects the format to be markdown, so export your notebook as a .md via the Jupyter web interface menu (File > Download As > Markdown). Then, to enable the download notebook button in the web site's UI ([example](https://mxnet.apache.org/tutorials/python/linear-regression.html)), add the following as the last line of the file ([example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blame/master/docs/tutorials/python/linear-regression.md#L194)):

```
<!-- INSERT SOURCE DOWNLOAD BUTTONS -->
```

If you want some lines to show-up in the markdown but not in the generated notebooks, add  this comment `<!--notebook-skip-line-->` after your `![png](img_url)`. Like this:

```
![png](img_url.png)<!--notebook-skip-line-->
```

Typically when you have a `plt.imshow()` you want the image tag `[png](img.png)` in the `.md` but not in the downloaded notebook as the user will re-generate the plot at run-time.

#### Tutorial tests

As part of making sure all our tutorials are running correctly with the latest version of MXNet, each tutorial is run automatically through a python2 and python3 jupyter notebook kernel in the CI, in a GPU environment, checking for errors and warnings.

Add your own test here `tests/tutorials/test_tutorials.py`. (If you forget, don't worry your PR will not pass the sanity check).

If your tutorial depends on specific packages, simply add them to this provisioning script: `ci/docker/install/ubuntu_tutorials.sh`
