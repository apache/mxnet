# Examples using Sparse Symbol API
This folder contains examples that demonstrate the usage of [Sparse Symbol API](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/symbol/sparse.html)
- [Factorization Machine](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/sparse/factorization_machine) uses sparse weights
- [Linear Classification Using Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/sparse/linear_classification) shows how to use a sparse data loader, sparse dot operator and sparse gradient updaters
- [Matrix Factorization w/ Sparse Embedding](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/sparse/matrix_factorization) uses sparse weights
- [Wide and Deep Learning](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/sparse/wide_deep) shows how to run sparse wide and deep classification
