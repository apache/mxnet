# Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)

An example of the binary RBM [1] learning the MNIST data. The RBM is implemented as a custom operator, and a gluon block is also provided. `binary_rbm.py` contains the implementation of the RBM. `binary_rbm_gluon.py` train the MNIST data using the gluon interface respectively. The MNIST data is downloaded automatically.

The progress of the learning is monitored by estimating the log-likelihood using the annealed importance sampling [2,3]. The learning with the default hyperparameters takes about 25 minutes on GTX 1080Ti and the resulting log-likelihood is around -70 for both testing and training datasets.

Here are some samples generated by the RBM with the default hyperparameters. The samples (right) are obtained by 3000 steps of Gibbs sampling starting from randomly chosen real images (left).
