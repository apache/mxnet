Installation Guide
==================

Automatic Installation
----------------------

To install MXNet.jl, simply type

```julia
Pkg.add("MXNet")
```

In the Julia REPL. Or to use the latest git version of MXNet.jl, use the
following command instead

```julia
Pkg.checkout("MXNet")
```

MXNet.jl is built on top of [libmxnet](https://github.com/apache/mxnet).
Upon installation, Julia will try to automatically download and build
libmxnet.

There are several environment variables that change this behaviour.

- `MXNET_HOME`: If you already have a pre-installed version of mxnet
  you can use `MXNET_HOME` to point the build-process in the right direction.
- `CUDA_HOME`: If the automatic cuda detection fails you can also set `CUDA_HOME`
  to override the process.
- `MXNET_COMMIT`: To control which version of libmxnet will be compiled,
  you can use the`MXNET_COMMIT` variable to point to either a version tag
  (e.g. `v0.10.0`), a branch name (e.g. `master`) or a specific commit hash
  (e.g. `a0b1c2d3`).
- `CC`: The path of C compiler.
- `CXX`: The path of C++ compiler.
- `ADD_CFLAGS`: Additional C flags. For instance,
  if you need to point non-standard include directory, please set it as
  `ENV["ADD_CFLAGS"] = "-I'/path/to/include/dir'"`.
- `ADD_LDFLAGS`: Additional linker flags.
- `USE_JEMALLOC`: Default is enabled if jemalloc available.
  If you ran into segfault cause by jemalloc,
  Please try to disable it.

  ```julia
  # first remove whole libmxnet source: Pkg.dir("MXNet", "deps", "src")
  ENV["USE_JEMALLOC"] = "0"
  Pkg.build("MXNet")
  ```

The libmxnet source is downloaded to `Pkg.dir("MXNet", "deps", "src", "mxnet")`.
The automatic build is using default configurations, with OpenCV disabled.
If the compilation failed due to unresolved dependency, or if
you want to customize the build, you can compile and
install libmxnet manually. Please see below for more details.

Manual Compilation
------------------

It is possible to compile libmxnet separately and point MXNet.jl to a
existing library in case automatic compilation fails due to
unresolved dependencies in an non-standard environment; Or when one want
to work with a separate, maybe customized libmxnet.

To build libmxnet, please refer to [the installation guide of
libmxnet](https://mxnet.apache.org/install/index.html). After
successfully installing libmxnet, set the `MXNET_HOME` *environment
variable* to the location of libmxnet. In other words, the compiled
`libmxnet.so` should be found in `$MXNET_HOME/lib`.

> **note**
>
> The constant `MXNET_HOME` is pre-compiled in MXNet.jl package cache.
> If you updated the environment variable after installing MXNet.jl,
> make sure to update the pre-compilation cache by
> `Base.compilecache("MXNet")`.

When the `MXNET_HOME` environment variable is detected and the
corresponding `libmxnet.so` could be loaded successfully, MXNet.jl will
skip automatic building during installation and use the specified
libmxnet instead.

Basically, MXNet.jl will search `libmxnet.so` or `libmxnet.dll` in the
following paths (and in that order):

-   `$MXNET_HOME/lib`: customized libmxnet builds
-   `Pkg.dir("MXNet", "deps", "usr", "lib")`: automatic builds
-   Any system wide library search path

Note that MXNet.jl can not load `libmxnet.so` even if it is on one of
the paths above in case a library it depends upon is missing from the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Thus, if you are going to compile to add CUDA, the
path to the CUDA libraries will have to be added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
