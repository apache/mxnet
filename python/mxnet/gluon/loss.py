class SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss(Loss):
    r"""The cross-entropy loss for binary classification. (alias: SigmoidBCELoss)

    BCE loss is useful when training logistic regression. If `from_sigmoid`
    is False (default), this loss computes:

    .. math::

        prob = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-{pred})}

        L = - \sum_i {label}_i * \log({prob}_i) * pos\_weight +
            (1 - {label}_i) * \log(1 - {prob}_i)

    If `from_sigmoid` is True, this loss computes:

    .. math::

        L = - \sum_i {label}_i * \log({pred}_i) * pos\_weight +
            (1 - {label}_i) * \log(1 - {pred}_i)

    A tensor `pos_weight > 1` decreases the false negative count, hence increasing
    the recall.
    Conversely setting `pos_weight < 1` decreases the false positive count and
    increases the precision.

    `pred` and `label` can have arbitrary shape as long as they have the same
    number of elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_sigmoid : bool, default is `False`
        Whether the input is from the output of sigmoid. Set this to false will make
        the loss calculate sigmoid and BCE together, which is more numerically
        stable through log-sum-exp trick.
    weight : float or None
        Global scalar weight for loss.
    batch_axis : int, default 0
        The axis that represents mini-batch.


    Inputs:
        - **pred**: prediction tensor with arbitrary shape
        - **label**: target tensor with values in range `[0, 1]`. Must have the
          same size as `pred`.
        - **sample_weight**: element-wise weighting tensor. Must be broadcastable
          to the same shape as pred. For example, if pred has shape (64, 10)
          and you want to weigh each sample in the batch separately,
          sample_weight should have shape (64, 1).
        - **pos_weight**: a weighting tensor of positive examples. Must be a vector with length
          equal to the number of classes.For example, if pred has shape (64, 10),
          pos_weight should have shape (1, 10).

    Parameters
    ----------
    layout : str, default 'NTC'
        Layout of prediction tensor. 'N', 'T', 'C' stands for batch size,
        sequence length, and alphabet_size respectively.
    label_layout : str, default 'NT'
        Layout of the labels. 'N', 'T' stands for batch size, and sequence
        length respectively.
    weight : float or None
        Global scalar weight for loss.


    Inputs:
        - **pred**: unnormalized prediction tensor (before softmax).
          Its shape depends on `layout`. If `layout` is 'TNC', pred
          should have shape `(sequence_length, batch_size, alphabet_size)`.
          Note that in the last dimension, index `alphabet_size-1` is reserved
          for internal use as blank label. So `alphabet_size` is one plus the
          actual alphabet size.

        - **label**: zero-based label tensor. Its shape depends on `label_layout`.
          If `label_layout` is 'TN', `label` should have shape
          `(label_sequence_length, batch_size)`.

        - **pred_lengths**: optional (default None), used for specifying the
          length of each entry when different `pred` entries in the same batch
          have different lengths. `pred_lengths` should have shape `(batch_size,)`.

        - **label_lengths**: optional (default None), used for specifying the
          length of each entry when different `label` entries in the same batch
          have different lengths. `label_lengths` should have shape `(batch_size,)`.

    Outputs:
        - **loss**: output loss has shape `(batch_size,)`.


    **Example**: suppose the vocabulary is `[a, b, c]`, and in one batch we
    have three sequences 'ba', 'cbb', and 'abac'. We can index the labels as
    `{'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2, blank: 3}`. Then `alphabet_size` should be 4,
    where label 3 is reserved for internal use by `CTCLoss`. We then need to
    pad each sequence with `-1` to make a rectangular `label` tensor::

        [[1, 0, -1, -1],
         [2, 1,  1, -1],
         [0, 1,  0,  2]]

    According to the authors, this loss formulation achieves comparable or higher accuracy to

    The loss assumes that the items in both tensors in each minibatch
    are aligned such that x1[0] corresponds to x2[0] and all other datapoints in the minibatch are unrelated.
    `x1` and  `x2` are minibatches of vectors.

        Probability mass to be distributed over the minibatch. Must be < 1.0.
    weight : float or None

    batch_axis : int, default 0

    Inputs:
        - **x1**: Minibatch of data points with shape (batch_size, vector_dim)
        - **x2**: Minibatch of data points with shape (batch_size, vector_dim)
          Each item in x2 is a positive sample for the same index in x1.
          That is, x1[0] and x2[0] form a positive pair, x1[1] and x2[1] form a positive pair - and so on.
