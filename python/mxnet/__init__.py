# With the native kvstore module (such as 'dist_sync_device'), the module launches a separate
# process when role is set to "server". This should be done after other modules are initialized.
# Otherwise this may result in errors when unpickling custom LR scheduler/optimizers.
# For example, the LRScheduler in gluoncv depends on a specific version of MXNet, and
# checks the __version__ attr of MXNet, which is not set on kvstore server due to the
# fact that kvstore-server module is imported before the __version__ attr is set.
