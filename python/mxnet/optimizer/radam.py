    This optimizer accepts the following parameters in addition to those accepted
    by :class:`.Optimizer`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    learning_rate : float, default 0.001
        The initial learning rate. If None, the optimization will use the
        learning rate from ``lr_scheduler``. If not None, it will overwrite
        the learning rate in ``lr_scheduler``. If None and ``lr_scheduler``
        is also None, then it will be set to 0.01 by default.
    beta1 : float, default 0.9
        Exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates.
    beta2 : float, default 0.999
        Exponential decay rate for the second moment estimates.
    epsilon : float, default 1e-8
        Small value to avoid division by 0.
    use_fused_step : bool, default False
        Whether or not to use fused kernels for optimizer.
        When use_fused_step=False, step is called,
        otherwise, fused_step is called.
