    """Draw samples from a uniform distribution.

    Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
    ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
    any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
    by `uniform`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : float, ndarray, optional
        Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
    high : float, ndarray, optional
        Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a scalar tensor containing a single value is returned if
        ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
    dtype : {'float16', 'float32', 'float64'}, optional
        Data type of output samples. Default is 'float32'
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.
