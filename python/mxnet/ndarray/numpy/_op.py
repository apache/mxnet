def arctan2(x1, x2, out=None, **kwargs):
    r"""
    arctan2(x1, x2, out=None)

    Element-wise arc tangent of ``x1/x2`` choosing the quadrant correctly.

    The quadrant (i.e., branch) is chosen so that ``arctan2(x1, x2)`` is
    the signed angle in radians between the ray ending at the origin and
    passing through the point (1,0), and the ray ending at the origin and
    passing through the point (`x2`, `x1`).  (Note the role reversal: the
    "`y`-coordinate" is the first function parameter, the "`x`-coordinate"
    is the second.)  By IEEE convention, this function is defined for
    `x2` = +/-0 and for either or both of `x1` and `x2` = +/-inf (see
    Notes for specific values).

    This function is not defined for complex-valued arguments; for the
    so-called argument of complex values, use `angle`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : ndarray or scalar
        `y`-coordinates.
    x2 : ndarray or scalar
        `x`-coordinates. `x2` must be broadcastable to match the shape of
        `x1` or vice versa.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
        Array of angles in radians, in the range ``[-pi, pi]``. This is a scalar if
        `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    Notes
    -----
    *arctan2* is identical to the `atan2` function of the underlying
    C library.  The following special values are defined in the C
    standard: [1]_

    ====== ====== ================
    `x1`   `x2`   `arctan2(x1,x2)`
    ====== ====== ================
    +/- 0  +0     +/- 0
    +/- 0  -0     +/- pi
        > 0   +/-inf +0 / +pi
        < 0   +/-inf -0 / -pi
    +/-inf +inf   +/- (pi/4)
    +/-inf -inf   +/- (3*pi/4)
    ====== ====== ================

    Note that +0 and -0 are distinct floating point numbers, as are +inf
    and -inf.

    This function differs from the original numpy.arange in the following aspects:
        - Only support float16, float32 and float64.

    References
    ----------
    .. [1] ISO/IEC standard 9899:1999, "Programming language C."

    Examples
    --------
    Consider four points in different quadrants:

    >>> x = np.array([-1, +1, +1, -1])
    >>> y = np.array([-1, -1, +1, +1])
    >>> np.arctan2(y, x) * 180 / np.pi
    array([-135.,  -45.,   45.,  135.])

    Note the order of the parameters. `arctan2` is defined also when `x2` = 0
    and at several other special points, obtaining values in
    the range ``[-pi, pi]``:

    >>> x = np.array([1, -1])
    >>> y = np.array([0, 0])
    >>> np.arctan2(x, y)
    array([ 1.5707964, -1.5707964])
