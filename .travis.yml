# We build with 2 concurrent jobs to match the number of cores present on MacOS virutal machines.

  # Temporarily disabled due to https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/13136
  # We ignore several tests to avoid possible timeouts on large PRs.
  # This lowers our test coverage, but is required for consistent Travis runs.
  # These tests will be tested in a variety of environments in Jenkins based tests.
