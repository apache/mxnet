Prerequisites
-------------
This package supports Linux and Windows platforms. You may also want to check:
- [mxnet-cu110](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu110/) with CUDA-11.0 support.
- [mxnet-cu102](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu102/) with CUDA-10.2 support.
- [mxnet-cu101](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu101/) with CUDA-10.1 support.
- [mxnet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet/).
- [mxnet-native](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-native/) CPU variant without oneDNN.

To download CUDA, check [CUDA download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). For more instructions, check [CUDA Toolkit online documentation](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html).

To use this package on Linux you need the `libquadmath.so.0` shared library. On
Debian based systems, including Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install libquadmath0` to
install the shared library. On RHEL based systems, including CentOS, run `sudo
yum install libquadmath` to install the shared library. As `libquadmath.so.0` is
a GPL library and MXNet part of the Apache Software Foundation, MXNet must not
redistribute `libquadmath.so.0` as part of the Pypi package and users must
manually install it.

To install for other platforms (e.g. Windows, Raspberry Pi/ARM) or other versions, check [Installing MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/master) for instructions on building from source.

Installation
------------
To install:
```bash
pip install mxnet-cu112
```
